## QUESTION 4

### What the drones do already

The reports sent by the peacewatchers already contain some useful information:
- The location of the drone allows a follow up on the drone itinary, as well as the concentration of drones in a certain area once analysis is performed.
- The list of citizens allows a follow up on citizen concentration, and can produce insights on highly frequented areas, as well as impacts of agitated citizens on their neighbours.
- The words heard in the surrounding, although not extracted from individuals but rather from crowds, can lead to a quick evaluation of the overall agitation in a area.

All of these can already provide a great deal of optimisation on drone courses, and help to set up a future system of predictive surveillance.

### What info could be missing

Drones could include the following on their reports:

- Location of the nearest peacemakers. This could take some time off processing if action is taken by the nearest Peacemakers, instead of informing all of them.

- Timestamp. Drones currently do not include in their reports the date and time of their current investigation. Adding a timestamp could have some impact on how the drone is proceeding in its course and on how it is adapting its measures to the changes of the ambient scenery.

- Previous peacescores, or delta from the last one. By keeping history of the evolution of each citizen's peacescore, the drone may be able to modify its behaviour, like focusing on a single citizen who have a significantly negative delta.

- Pictures/videos of the scene. Citizens might get clever and communicate by other means than oral speech, like written messages or sign language. The processing could take into account citizens physical behaviour when the drone flew by them.

Although some of those represent a heavier data load, they add more criterias for triggering alerts.
